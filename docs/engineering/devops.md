# DevOps

Documentation of our DevOps setup.

## Continuous Integration

Many quality controls are enforced both locally and remote using pre-commit.
Furthermore, we aim to have a high test coverage for all our code (unit and end-to-end).

## Continuous Deployment

We aim to deploy to production as often as possible.
We use a combination of Docker and Terraform to deploy our services.
